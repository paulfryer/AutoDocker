# AutoDocker

AutoDocker is a tool designed to automatically build Docker files for .NET solutions, eliminating the need for developers to manually create and maintain Docker files. It uses reflection of .NET solutions to generate appropriate Docker files, streamlining the containerization process.

## Features

- Automatic Docker file generation for .NET solutions
- Integration with AWS services for deployment
- Support for multiple projects within a solution
- Automatic creation of ECR repositories and ECS tasks

## Workflow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B[Analyze Solution]
    B --> C{For each project}
    C --> D[Generate Dockerfile]
    D --> E[Create ECR Repository]
    E --> F[Create ECS Task Definition]
    F --> G[Update CodePipeline]
    G --> C
    C --> H[End]
```

## Architecture

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[AutoDocker] --> B[AWS CodeCommit]
    A --> C[AWS CodeBuild]
    A --> D[AWS CodePipeline]
    B --> D
    C --> D
    D --> E[AWS ECR]
    D --> F[AWS ECS]
    E --> F
```

## How it works

1. AutoDocker analyzes the .NET solution structure
2. For each project, it generates an appropriate Dockerfile
3. It creates necessary AWS resources (ECR repositories, ECS tasks)
4. Sets up a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline
5. Automates the build and deployment process
